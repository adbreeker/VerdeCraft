# VerdeCraft
Minecraft plugin

In repository you can find 4 directories:

-src              here you can check plugin code

-VerdeCraft.zip   this is compresed full project if you want to make some upgrades

-VerdeCraft.jar   this is the plugin itself, add it to your plugins directory to use it,
                  main minecraft version for this plugin is 1.19 but it possibly works on other versions
                  
-VerdeCraft Texturepack.zip   this is compresed texturepack folder, its not necessary but highly recommended 
                              to take advantage of those customized texture for our plugin, 
                              if you want to use it just unpack this zip in resourcepack folder in your .minecraft
                  
*Plugin is adapted to PaperMc servers, i am not sure if it works on other server types.
                 
          
          
Good luck and have fun!
